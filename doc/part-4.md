## Part 4: Field of View

Tutorial link [SelinaDev Godot 4: Part 3](https://selinadev.github.io/08-rogueliketutorial-04/)

Field of view. I'm not going to invent or research anything here, it will be reading, typing and maybe even copy-pasting.

I will try and understand what is happening, big picture. Maybe I'll refactor or touch up on a bit before moving on to placing enemies in the next part.

### Thoughts

 - The tileset I use have a grey pattern for the walls, instead of white. This makes colour masking them not automatic. I'll have to find out how to change the base colour, or modify the image myself.
