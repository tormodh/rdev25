## Part 4: Field of View

Tutorial link [SelinaDev Godot 4: Part 3](https://selinadev.github.io/08-rogueliketutorial-04/)

Field of view. I'm not going to invent or research anything here, it will be reading, typing and maybe even copy-pasting.

I will try and understand what is happening, big picture. Maybe I'll refactor or touch up on a bit before moving on to placing enemies in the next part.

Note: Nope. Copy-pasted the algorithm, typed up the other bits. I know I have ported this to Java many years ago, but I cannot remember which implementation I started from.

### Thanks

I'm using SelinaDev's Godot implementainion, straight out of the tutorial, of Bjørn Bergstrøm's recursive shadowcasting algorithm. There are a few other people/steps in there; it is ported from the C++ version, which is a port of a python implementation of the algorithm. Shoulders, giants.
