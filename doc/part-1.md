## Part 2: Drawing the Player Character and Moving it Around

This part has been straight forward a copy paste from the tutorial. As of now there is little to change; it is just a black triangle.

Did set the grid size to 64 to accomodate the different texture, and I do not include the png in git since it is licensed as do not distribute. I guess the freebie could be distributed, but just to learn I will keep it out. I will add to the README.md (and test) how to download and add the graphics pack to the project.

I also noted that SelinaDev will do input differently this year, I'll have to try and gleam what insight I can from that.

Next plan is to learn more of Godot, and find out how I will structure resources, scripts and stuff. Learning experience.
