## Part 0: Setting up

Tutorial link [SelinaDev Godot 4: Part 0 and 1](https://selinadev.github.io/05-rogueliketutorial-01/)

I've downloaded Godot 4.4.1, created an empty project - and committed the initial commit (no changes).

This year I'll follow SelinaDev's Godot 4 tutorial. I did that last year as well, but started late and did nothing _On my own_. This year I'll try and branch out a bit, trying different things and learning in the process.

For graphics I'll try to use the Delve Set (freebies part) by Jonathan Everett - https://buddyboybueno.itch.io/

Font will have to be noted later.
